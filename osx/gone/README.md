Simple application to lock my screen from the command line. Problem is I don't have an
eject _or_ power button on a logitech keyboard so I have way to lock up on a Mac Pro.
This gives me one consistent quick way to lock the screen that _always_ works. Stolen
from [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/80058/lock-screen-command-one-liner).
